Challenge 1:
I fixed code in /home/ctrivinm/proyecto/the-real-devops-challenge/src/mongoflask.py
also fix app.py to return 204 code if no match results.
Challenge 2:
I created pipeline which run python test
https://circleci.com/gh/triviman/workflows/the-real-devops-challenge
Challenge 3 & 4:
I created docker folder with Dockerfiles
I added to pipeline the builds of app container and mongodb container
Challenge 5:
I added docker-compose file to run local docker-compose up
Challenge 6:
I added k8s folder with deployment, services and configmaps, this configuration is too simple because is necessary that works in microk8s, not ingress or hpa resources were added
