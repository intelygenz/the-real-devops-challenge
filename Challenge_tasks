For the challenge:


#### Little note: it seems that a year not using docker and jenkins, 
#### and 5 months of unemployment seems to take its toll on what it was my daily job,
#### so, apologies if you find some big mistakes, I would be much more efficiently if I were working :D

# The challenge:

1. For this part I take the position 0 of the list returned, an object, for further development, I would return only the object from the function instead of a list.

2. I upload a very simple jenkins pipeline for build and test with tox

3. I have build and deployed a docker container, modified from a debian. The Dockerfile is in the root folder, and the image is at jcstdio/intely_app.

4. I have build deployed a modified version of the mongo image in a container. Can be find in jcstdio/intely_mongodb.

5.  The docker-compose.yml can be find in the root folder.
  - It deploys a container with the modified mongo image, 
    - With the port mapped to 27017:27017
    - And a volume for persistent data mapped at ./mongo/data:/data/db
  - Deploy a second container with the intely_app image,
    - With the port mapped to 8080:8080
    - The dependency of the mongodb container
    - And the environment variable MONGO_URI, to set the connection for the app to the mongodb.
    
6. I've added two yaml files to deploy on kubernetes 
  - intely_mongo.yaml
  - intely_app.yaml
  
  
  
#### Hope you are having a nice summer.
