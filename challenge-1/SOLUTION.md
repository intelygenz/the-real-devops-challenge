To create a simple web server in Python that listens on port 8000 and returns specific information when a request is made, you can use the http.server module, which is part of the Python standard library. Below is an example of how to implement such a server using Python:

This script defines a custom request handler class CustomHandler that inherits from BaseHTTPRequestHandler. The do_GET method is overridden to handle GET requests. When a GET request is received, the server responds with a 200 OK status, sets the Content-Type header to text/plain, and sends a plain text response.
To run the server, simply execute the script. The server will start listening on port 8000, and you can test it by navigating to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser or using a tool like curl.
Please note that the http.server module is not recommended for production use due to its basic security checks

. It is suitable for development and testing purposes. If you plan to deploy a web server for production, consider using a more robust framework like Flask or Django.
Additionally, if you encounter issues with connecting to the server, ensure that the firewall settings allow traffic on port 8000 and that the server is bound to the correct network interface


To create a Dockerfile for the Python web server script that listens on port 8000, you can follow these steps:
Create a file named Dockerfile in the same directory as your Python script.
Use the following content for your Dockerfile

Replace webserver.py with the actual name of your Python script if it's different.
Build the Docker image by running the following command in your terminal

docker build -t my-python-server .

Once the image is built, you can run it with:

docker run -p 8000:8000 my-python-server



This command will start a container instance from your image, forwarding the local port 8000 to the container's port 8000.
The Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.8 image as a base, sets a working directory, copies the application files into the container, exposes port 8000, sets an environment variable to unbuffer Python output (so you can see the output in real-time), and specifies the command to run the server when the container starts.
Remember to replace my-python-server with a name that is relevant to your application. Also, ensure that your Python script is named webserver.py or update the CMD in the Dockerfile accordingly.
Please note that the http.server module is not recommended for production use due to its basic security checks
