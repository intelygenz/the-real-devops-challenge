To deploy your Python web server application on Kubernetes with a Helm chart and expose it using an Ingress controller, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Helm Chart
Install Helm on your local machine. You can find installation instructions on the official Helm website or use a package manager like Homebrew on macOS.
Create a new Helm chart for your application:

bash
helm create my-python-server-chart

Customize the Helm chart by editing the values.yaml file and other templates in the templates/ directory. You'll need to set the Docker image to the one you built for your Python server and configure the service type and port

.
Step 2: Define the Kubernetes Deployment
Edit the deployment.yaml file in the templates/ directory of your Helm chart to define the Kubernetes Deployment. Here's an example:

Step 3: Define the Kubernetes Service
Edit the service.yaml file in the templates/ directory to define the Kubernetes Service. Here's an example:

This will create a service that routes traffic to your application on port 8000.

Step 4: Define the Ingress Resource
Create an ingress.yaml file in the templates/ directory to define the Ingress resource. Here's an example using Nginx as the Ingress controller:

Step 5: Deploy the Application Using Helm
Deploy your application to Kubernetes using Helm:

This command deploys your Python web server application to Kubernetes using the Helm chart you've created.
Step 6: Set Up the Ingress Controller
If you haven't already set up an Ingress controller in your Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to do so. You can choose between different Ingress controllers like Nginx or Traefik. Follow the official documentation of the Ingress controller you choose for setup instructions.


Step 7: Access the Application
Once the Ingress controller is set up and the Helm chart is deployed, you should be able to access your Python web server application through the domain you specified in the Ingress resource.
